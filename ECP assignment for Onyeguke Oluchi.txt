                                    ASSIGNMENT
BETWEEN A SUPER COMPUTER AND A 9 YEARS OLD CHILD WHICH HAS MORE INTELLIGENCE, SPEED AND POWER.
A Computer is an electronic device that performs tasks quickly and effectively by running computer programs to it has been programmed with. While 9 years old child is human being that has the ability to perform tasks through the help of his or her environment.
In my last class on the Course, ECP (COMPUTER PROGRAMMING FOR ENGINEERING) this was a major discussion in the class where ideas and perspectives of understanding were shared and were duly taken note of. Below are some points given by my course mates ;
	1. That a Super Computer has more intelligence in terms of having to perform tasks, while some said that the 9 years old child is more intelligent.


	2. That a Super Computer has more speed in terms of having to perform tasks and process information,


     	3. That a Super Computer has more power than the 9 years old child.

                           MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION
1. It’s says Computers are programmed to do tasks. Computers are fed with high amount of data to which they use to perform tasks, and are also trained to perform actions by themselves without the aid of Humans by running them with models known as MACHINE LEARNING MODELS such as self-driving cars etc. But there is a limitation in that what isn’t programmed for the computer it can’t perform, this is where the 9 years old child has the upper hand because his or her learns based on his or her environment.
2. A Computer has more speed than the 9 years old child. The computer process data and brings it out as information with speed because that what it was specially created for, while humans process information at a slower rate due to Human factors such as feeding, shelter, clothing this makes them to be ever ready to give information .
3. A Computer has more power because they work on very high Processors. Research has it that some computer processes at 2.4MHz and above there by making them extremely fast with more power. If a Human being is to process at such frequency then that human will definitely be death.
